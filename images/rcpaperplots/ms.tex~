\begin{abstract}
An ultraviolet-optical color is a unique probe of red clump (RC) stars because they are particularly faint in ultraviolet wavelengths. We propose a dust corrected ultraviolet-optical (NUV - G)$_0$ color-[Fe/H] metallicity photometric relation using a sample of 228 RC stars from APOGEE with data from GALEX and TGAS. We show this relation has a scatter of 0.01 dex, or better and less costly than low-resolution spectroscopic metallicities currently available. The RC has a 4-magnitude range in (NUV - G)$_0$ color, compared to a 0.6-magnitude range in (B - V)$_0$. We show that the UV-optical color is so strongly correlated with metallicity that it is a good metallicity indicator for these stars. We find that spectroscopic metallicity is strongly related to RC star’s location in the UV-optical color magnitude diagram. The effect may be comparable to the spread in RC color attributed to extinction in other studies.

\section{Introduction}
The Milky Way is host to a variety of stars spanning the entire stellar lifetime range. Average stars like our Sun eventually become red giants, some of which populate a prominent feature in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) called the red clump (RC) consisting of low-mass, metal-rich stars in the core helium-burning stage of stellar evolution. A sizable fraction of Solar neighborhood giants observed with Hipparcos are RC candidates (60$\%$, \citealt{girardi16}). Metallicities for these stars are readily available from surveys using APOGEE. The metallicity of RC stars can reveal details about their age and their location along the horizontal branch (\citealt{girardi16}).

With the release of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS, \citealt{gaia}), the Milky Way can now be probed to greater depths than ever before. The TGAS release presents parallax measurements for $\sim$2 million stars, which provide crucial distance information and G-band measurements that can place stars on CMDs. We combine NUV-band data from the GALEX All-sky Imaging Survey (GAIS) with TGAS and two catalogs of known RC stars. RC stars are very faint in NUV and should separate well from the main sequence. RC stars have not been extensively probed in UV so this study has the potential to strengthen the relation between color and metallicity. In this study, we observe a (NUV - G)$_0$ color-metallicity relation. We compare our catalog of RC stars to other magnitudes and show a (NUV - G)$_0$ spread that is large enough to allow a direct comparison to [Fe/H]. 

\section{Observations}
\subsection{Red Clump data}
We build a sample of 228 RC stars from the APOGEE survey (Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, \citealt{apogee2017}). APOGEE is a near-infrared (1.51-1.70 μm) spectroscopic high signal-to-noise survey of over 100,000 red giant stars in the Milky Way. The sample consists of objects either observed by Kepler and thus were seismically determined (\citealt{APOKASC}) or those from \citealt{bovy14} (hereby B14), requiring that they were in TGAS. APOKASC is a cross match that utilizes APOGEE's spectroscopic and Kepler's asteroseismic data, the only selection criteria being that the object is present in both catalogs and they have T$_{\rm{eff}}$ and metallicity measurements. B14 select their RC stars using stellar evolution codes, primarily from PARSEC (\citealt{parsec}). They compare theoretical log g and T$_{\rm{eff}}$ from PARSEC with \citealt{APOKASC} and find that the two agree within the log g vs T$_{\rm{eff}}$ space that the red clump populates. They also make use of color, log g, and T$_{\rm{eff}}$ cuts to further remove contamination from RGB stars. A wealth of metallicity information is available for APOKASC and B14 for many elements as well as useful parameters such as log g and T$_{\rm{eff}}$, most of which we will not discuss within this letter. APOGEE set a requirement that elemental abundances be accurate to 0.2 dex. When compared to mean abundances for cluster stars, this requirement is met for [Fe/H] except below about -1.5. This ensures the quality of the elemental abundances we use in this paper.

\subsection{GAIS, TGAS, and APASS}
GAIS contains NUV data for over 16 million objects across the entire sky. TGAS provides Gaia G-band magnitudes and parallaxes that can be used to obtain distance information. The errors in NUV and G are of the order of millimagnitudes. We use a small correction to the TGAS parallaxes as shown:
\begin{equation}
    p_{new} = p_{old}(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1 - 16\sigma^{2}/p_{old}^{2}})
\end{equation} 
where p$_{old}$ is the original TGAS parallax and $\sigma$ is the parallax error (\citealt{lutzkelker73}, \citealt{Oudmaijer98}). We then invert the parallax to get a distance. Finally for comparison with our unique GAIS-TGAS data we use B and V photometry from the AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey (\citealt{APASS}). APASS in total has B, V, g', r', and i' data. To cross-match these data we use the astropy (\citealt{astropy}) function \textit{search around sky} with a search radius of 3 arcseconds with a 76\% (228 out of 299) match rate. In total we have coverage in GALEX NUV, Gaia G-band, APASS B, V, g', r', i', and 2MASS J, H, and K.

\begin{figure}[]

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{cmd_6panel.png}
\caption{GAIS-TGAS matches with RC stars. The top panels are without an extinction correction and the bottom panels use a correction from \citealt{SF11} (with R$_B$ = 3.626 and R$_V$ = 2.742 for B and V). The left two panels show M$_V$ vs B - V and the right two show M$_G$ vs NUV - G. The main locus at the center of each panel shows the Main Sequence and the RC stars are overlaid and colored by [Fe/H]. There is a clear trend of metallicity with NUV - G color in both cases.}
\end{figure}

Extinction plays a much larger role in NUV than the other bands due to absorption from dust in our galaxy (\citealt{ccm89}). It will have a nontrivial effect on the location of objects in a CMD. To account for this reddening we use the 3D dust map from \citealt{GSF15} which gives E$_{B - V}$ as a function of distance in conjunction with TGAS parallax-derived distances to get the reddening in the line of sight of each object in this catalog. The NUV - G color is dust corrected (indicated by a 0 subscript) using these E$_{B - V}$ values and R$_{\lambda}$ from two sources: \citealt{yuan13} for NUV and G and B and V from \citealt{SF11}. We use the SDSS g band as an approximation for Gaia G because the G bandpass is very large. This is approximately correct for R values between 2.4 and 3.6 (\citealt{jordi2010}). The corrections for NUV and G are applied as follows: is defined as NUV$_0$ = NUV - E$_{B - V}$ $\times$ 7.24 and G$_0$ = G - E$_{B - V}$ $\times$ 3.303. 

We are restricted to the range of the \citealt{GSF15} map and remove any objects in the GAIS+TGAS catalog that do not overlap with the map. Our requirements for the final catalog are that they have photometry in NUV, G, B and V, and also metallicity and T$_{\rm{eff}}$ measurements. We do not require the APOGEE flags to be set to 0 for these objects (31 in total) however the removal of these objects do not impact our results. Our final catalog of GAIS, TGAS, APASS, and 3D dust map objects contains 476,163 objects. We cross-match this catalog with both the RC catalogs revealing 20 matches in the APOKASC catalog and 208 in the B14 sample. 

Figure 1 shows a CMD using (NUV - G)$_0$. The general shape is what we would expect from a CMD: a large main sequence with the red giant branch and red clump prominently displayed. The main sequence stretches from (NUV - G)$_0$ = 8 and M$_G$ = 6 to (NUV - G)$_0$ = 2 and M$_G$ = 0 where the bulk of the survey matches appear. The secondary locus around (NUV - G)$_0$ = 8.5 and M$_G$ = 0.4 (\citealt{hawkins17}) is populated by red giants, notably RC stars. The spread of the entire CMD in (NUV - G)$_0$ is unlike that seen in (J - K)$_0$, spreading over 8 magnitudes compared to a spread of 2 magnitudes in (J - K)$_0$. The spread could be due to the age, metallicity, and extinction of the RC stars. 

\section{Results}
The RC stars are separate from main sequence stars in the CMD and show an initial color-dependant trend with [Fe/H] (higher [Fe/H] at redder (NUV - G)$_0$ and vice-versa, shown in Figure 1, right panels). This spread is unique to (NUV - G)$_0$ color, especially when the dust correction is applied. Reproducing the same plot using APASS B - V (Figure 1, left panels) shows a much weaker relation that spreads only over 0.6 magnitudes. In Figure 1, the number of objects in the RC region is 40,593, or about 10 percent of the total catalog. B14 show there is a color-magnitude-metallicity relation of RC stars using 2MASS J - K$_s$ color but this relation only spreads over 0.6 mag, similar to the (B - V)$_0$ color plot while the spread in (NUV - G)$_0$ is greater, spanning over 4 magnitudes. The standard deviations between the two are similar with (NUV - G)$_0$ being smaller: $\sigma_{B-V_0}$ = 0.16 and $\sigma_{NUV-G_0}$ = 0.11.

\section{Discussion}
The spread in M$_V$ is the same as in M$_G$, spanning absolute magnitudes from -1 to 2. GAIS+TGAS does not appear to be limited to only very blue objects despite the expectation that GALEX would not observe many red stars as well as the existence of a large population where we expect the red clump to be in the CMD. For objects more luminous than m$_{NUV_0}$ = 20, there is about 76$\%$ of objects in the main catalog along the Main Sequence versus 13$\%$ of objects in the red clump. This region contains many possible RC candidates from which we can derive asteroseismic parameters with minimal contamination from RGB stars using the methods in \citealt{hawkins18}. The main two sources of bias come first from the current TGAS data release containing only stars observed with Tycho (the full GAIA DR1 contains $\sim$1 billion objects but only the TGAS subset contains parallax and photometric data for $\sim$2.5 million stars) and from dust extinction in NUV which would restrict the range of objects detectable by GALEX. Most of the RC objects discussed in this paper are within 1 kpc (67$\%$) which match the distance distribution of the B14 RC stars using their derived distances. 

%[Discuss volume completeness here and look for how many GALEX objects are non-detections in NUV, or if GALEX even observes those regions.].

We have removed 10 stars with errors higher than two standard deviations. The removal of these objects has a negligible effect on our analysis.}
\end{figure}

There is a clear trend between (NUV - G)$_0$ color and metallicity that spans a wider range of color than in optical wavelengths as shown in Figure 1. This relation becomes much tighter when an extinction correction is added (Figure 4). (B - V) is known to correlate with [Fe/H] (\citealt{girardi01}, \citealt{bilir13}) even at very low metallicities. At the very metal poor end ([Fe/H] $<$ -0.6) RC stars appear to be a part of the galaxy's thick disk (\citealt{brook12}, \citealt{hawkins15}) and from Figure 2 they are bluer objects in general. T$_{\rm{eff}}$ and metallicity are intertwined (\citealt{onal16}) and T$_{\rm{eff}}$ is derived from colors so it is implied that metallicity is tied to colors. We see this two ways in Figure 2. RC stars are used as standard candles in infrared due to their constant absolute magnitude and color. Metallicity, mass, age, and extinction make their use as standard candles difficult in bluer wavelengths.

The brighter the RC is in (NUV - G)$_0$, the lower the metallicity is of the stars. The dimmer it is, the older the stars are (\citealt{monachesi11}). Compared to Figure 2c in \citealt{bilir13}, whose RC stars from globular and open clusters, their (B - V)$_0$ measurements range from 0.4 to 1.2 versus our much bluer (NUV - G)$_0$ subset from 7 to 11. 

%[Again check to see if objects are GALEX non-detections and add numbers here].

Figure 2 shows [$\alpha$/Fe] vs [Fe/H] and distinguishes between thin and thick disk stars using a simple cut in [$\alpha$/Fe] (\citealt{hawkins15}, \citealt{nidever14}). The thick disk stars overall have a much higher [$\alpha$/Fe], especially at lower [Fe/H]. The [$\alpha$/Fe] - [Fe/H] relation is a unique way to separate different Galactic components to understand the star formation history of different parts of the Milky Way. The thin disk stars are thought to be considerably younger than the thick disk stars because of the smaller amount of $\alpha$ elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) for a given [Fe/H]. We see the same separation as in \citealt{nidever14} between the low and high $\alpha$ sequence around [Fe/H] = 0.2. 

\begin{figure}[]

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{teffvsnuvgvsfeh.png}
\caption{T$_{\rm{eff}}$ from APOGEE vs extinction corrected (B - V)$_0$ and (NUV - G)$_0$ colored by [Fe/H] for our RC sample. (B - V)$_0$ correlates very poorly with T$_{\rm{eff}}$ and has a lot of scatter at bluer colors. While there is some scatter on the blue end for a given T$_{\rm{eff}}$, there is still a strong trend between (NUV - G)$_0$ and T$_{\rm{eff}}$ ($\sigma_{T_{\rm{eff, (NUV - G)}}}$ = 72.6 K versus $\sigma_{T_{\rm{eff, (B - V)}}}$ = 100.5 K.)}
\end{figure}

The trend between (B - V)$_0$ and T$_{\rm{eff}}$ is weak but T$_{\rm{eff}}$ correlates with (NUV - G)$_0$ quite well. [Fe/H] also correlates very well with T$_{\rm{eff}}$ and (NUV - G)$_0$. We fit several lines to both B - V and NUV - G with and without their dust corrections. There is a strong linear trend between (NUV - G)$_0$ and the metallicity of a star (Figure 4). Removing 5 outliers due to their abnormal color gives us the following relationship:

\begin{equation}
    [Fe/H] = 0.237 (NUV - G)_0 - 2.061.
\end{equation}

The standard deviation from the linear fit is $\sigma_{\rm{[Fe/H]}}$ $\sim$ 0.10 dex. This indicates that Equation 2 represents a new and highly improved way to determine metallicity from photometry with a precision similar to low-resolution spectroscopy (e.g. SDSS SEGUE, \citealt{lee2011}, where they measure [Fe/H] to a precision of 0.23 dex) but at a much cheaper cost and can be obtained for many more stars. Even when the outliers are added in this relation still is more precise than spectroscopy. The power in this relation lies in the spread caused by NUV. This color-metallicity trend in (B - V)$_0$ and (NUV - G)$_0$ could be caused by a few effects. Metals in stellar atmospheres absorb blue light due to metal line blanketing in and should show significant absorption in blue wavelengths like NUV. In our sample these metal-rich stars are the reddest, with (NUV - G)$_0$ values reaching up to 10 magnitudes versus the blue end containing the most metal poor stars (Figure 4). Figure 4b (right panel) applies a dereddening correction which greatly decreases the scatter between color and metallicity. Due to their similarity, this relation should hold for stars along the giant branch albeit with increased scatter. The error bars are from TGAS, GAIS and B14 for NUV, G and [Fe/H] respectively and are much smaller than the spread in the trend at a given (NUV - G)$_0$. 

\begin{figure*}[]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fehvsnuvgvsalphafe_2panelext.png}
\caption{[Fe/H] vs (NUV - G)$_0$ colored by [$\alpha$/Fe] without (left) and with (right) an extinction correction. There are five outliers at (NUV - G)$_0$ $<$ 6.6 that are colored in red. We also highlight thick disk stars in blue. The red line fits to all the data including these excluded points and the black line omits them. We exclude these outliers from our discussion due to their abnormal color. It is possible they are binaries. We include all four fits and fit errors in their corresponding panels. The (NUV - G)$_0$ spread over 3 magnitudes is much greater than in optical colors. The color-metallicity relation has a weak dependence on [$\alpha$/Fe]. The trend is much stronger when corrected for extinction.}
\end{figure*}

For a given (NUV - G)$_0$, the thick disk stars have a lower [Fe/H] than their thin disk counterparts. While none of the stars are metal poor enough to be considered halo stars (typically metallicities of [Fe/H] $<$ -0.5), they are not visibly different from the entire sample in other quantities except [$\alpha$/Fe], where they are visibly larger for any given [Fe/H] (Figure 2). The majority of thick disk stars in this sample are bluer and cooler than the sample (Figure 2). 

The metallicity-color trend is noticeably different using (NUV - G)$_0$ than (B - V)$_0$, where the scatter is much smaller. A dereddened (NUV - G)$_0$ can be used as a reliable predictor of metallicity. Using the trend discussed in this paper we can predict metallicities for stars based only on their (NUV - G)$_0$ color. (NUV - G)$_0$ is able to predict metallicities of RC candidates better than optical colors due to the larger effect of metal-line blanketing in the UV than in optical colors. A large number of objects in the RC range in GAIS+TGAS could be RC stars but there would also be a large contamination percentage from other giants. Their location in the galaxy will also help indicate what metallicities we should expect and in what environment they formed.

Photometric-metallicity relations have been calculated or observed in the past. For example, \citealt{ivezic2008} use F and G main-sequence stars to derive a relation between [Fe/H], u - g and g - r. The u - g color, or the UV excess, depends on metallicity because of the high absorption of metals at bluer colors, affecting the star's flux. This UV excess depends on the g - r color which is related to the star's effective temperature. Red clump stars are known to have a flux-temperature relation that varies greatly depending on the metallicity. Metal line blanketing may also play a role due to the high [Fe/H] values in this sample (\citealt{girardi16}, \citealt{choi16}). 

These results also have implications on the use of RC stars as extinction probes (see e.g. \citealt{girardi16}). \citealt{yanchulova17} use HST observations that extend to the NUV and explain the spread in color as due to extinction. They conclude the RC is confined to a small region in the CMD with similar metallicities. We would expect to see a large spread in (NUV - G)$_0$ over a comparable metallicity range, indicating that metallicity may play a non-trivial role in understanding the RC in CMD space.

\section{Conclusion}
Using a sample of 228 RC stars from APOGEE with data from GALEX and TGAS, we identify the red clump in UV-optical CMD space as well as the existence of a color-metallicity relation that is tighter in (NUV - G)$_0$ than (B - V)$_0$.  We see a strong dependence of color on T$_{\rm{eff}}$ and metallicity. As part of this analysis, we apply a Galactic extinction correction using a 3-D dust map from \citealt{GSF15} and GAIA distances, which further tightens the relation. If we separate the sample into thin and thick disk stars, thick disk stars appear bluer than their thin disk counterparts for a given temperature and redder at a fixed metallicity. Finally, we find a tight relation between (NUV - G)$_0$ and [Fe/H] with a standard deviation of~ $\sigma$ = 0.10 that can be used to estimate stellar metallicities of RC stars when a metallicity measurement is missing. This relation will be used to obtain photometric metallicities from other stars in the same CMD space as RC candidates using only their UV-optical color. 
We will greatly increase the number of RC stars in our sample with the upcoming Gaia DR2 release. It will contain multiband photometry (G, G$_{BP}$ and G$_{RP}$ bands) and parallaxes for one billion stars. We will compare the new photometry to these methods to see how well we can constrain the photometric-metallicity relation in RC stars. As for our UV measurements, an NUV GALEX Plane Survey (Mohammed et al., in prep) will provide NUV measurements for the Galactic Plane for the first time using GALEX. This survey will provide millions of new objects brighter than NUV = 20 magnitude that will aid in RC investigations as well as many other fields in Galactic astronomy. Spectroscopic followup of these candidates could confirm their RC status using the method of \citealt{hawkins18} and allow us to further understand the UV-optical color-metallicity-age relation. RC stars are excellent extinction probes and if their metallicity is known it is enough to use a CMD to fit for its extinction values. Using our color-metallicity relation in conjunction with extinction measurements from \citealt{GSF15} we can narrow the variables to mass and age. \citealt{girardi16} discuss using many different bands to minimize RC population effects but none of these studies are at a bluer wavelength than I band, giving an opening to future ultraviolet RC studies.
