AAS talk outline:

Slide 1:
- Plane surveys over many wavelengths
- Many UV telescopes existed but either provided spotty coverage or low resolution data

Slide 2:
- GALEX was the latest UV telescope from a 10 year long mission
- Producted 3 surveys, A, M, and DIS using pointing method
- Still avoided the Galactic plane due to bright star restrictions
- At end of lifetime, restrictions were relaxed and data finally started coming in of GP

Slide 3:
- UVGAPS: The Ultraviolet Galactic Plane Survey (authors)
- Highest resolution and largest footprint of the Galactic plane that exists
- Quality comparable to previous GALEX data

Slide 4: 
- Intensity maps were created using count and exposure maps (pipeline by Wang et al)
- Show GP images, highlight regions
- Galactic center is obscured due to dust, but many features are visible 
- Exposure times varried between each scan. Some scans did not reach gb = -10 to 10 
- (Talk about the pipeline/distortion map?)


Slide 5:
- Source EXtractor was used on the images with custom input file
- Flow chart: run SE, get bkmap, manually subtract, run SE with 0 bk sub
- Yielded about ~3 million objects (add calculation for what we expect to see)


Slide 6: Calibration
- Are our outputs correct?
- FWHM vs NUV plot
- Compared to AIS, yielded n objects between the two
- NUV histogram vs NUV histogram of AIS, then offset by magnitude
- Slight offset between the two due to a few things:
-- Drift scan vs stare mode, slightly different/updated pipeline
- Manually subtract 0.2 mag from all observations

Slide 7: Other surveys
-Compared to Gaia DR2, PS1, AIS
-- Show NUV histograms
- GAIA DR2 CMD. RC, WDs, main sequence visible. Show comparison to AIS with dust from GSF17
- Pan-STARRs color-color plots. gr vs nuvg
- Show cc plot again but highlight different regions from Gaia CMD

Slide 8: How useful is this survey actually?
- Catalog of OB stars via color color and CMD
- Red Clump stars
- Dust!

Slide 9: Red Clump stars in AIS
- Looking at RC stars, separate from rest of cmd in AIS
- Compare to results from APOGEE. Show CMD for AIS and Gaia BPRP
- Compared to catalog from Ting+18. Yielded 5157 objects
-- Show histograms of gb, ext, etc

Slide 10:
- NUV-g vs TEFF
- Alpha/Fe vs Fe/H separation. Use as two different groups

Slide 11:
- Finally Fe/H vs NUV-G trend. Add trend lines
- If used as a test set on AIS data, still fits the trend

Slide 12: 
- Use RC as a metallicity finder for RC stars in AIS and UVGAPS

Slide 13:
Conclusions
